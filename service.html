    <h2>Our Services</h2>

    <p>
      When ordering a home through Affordable Housing, you’ll have the opportunity to schedule a private meeting with one of our licensed real estate agents. These meetings can be held in person or virtually, depending on your schedule and location. During in-person viewings, you’ll receive a guided tour of the property, have your questions answered on the spot, and get a full sense of the home’s space and condition.
    </p>

    <p>
      If an in-person visit isn’t possible, we’ve got you covered. Each home listing includes high-quality photos, and you can request additional angles or details directly from the homeowner. We also offer live video walk-throughs with the agent, where you can see every room in real-time and ask for close-ups of areas that matter to you. Our goal is to give you full confidence in your purchase, no matter where you are.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additional services include mortgage pre-approval guidance, legal document support, and post-sale consultation. We’re here to make the home buying process smooth, transparent, and tailored to your needs.
